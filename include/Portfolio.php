            <p class="card-text">Startup project for a fashion advice application. My job was to correct trouble tickets to fix visual as well as functional elements.

Wrote the sorting algorith and the functionality for all child elements to sort when controlling child sort option was selected. Redesigned the Vuex state manager to reduce backend Querries reducing load times. Git manager in charge of creating new sprints and merging into development branch for testing and QA review.

            <p class="card-text">Asked to put together a simple static site to be used for a Social Media Marketing Campaign. The requirements were for it to be responsive, collect emails, and send an email response. A good weekend project, deployed it to Firebase as a severless app, used their realtime db for the email collection, and a wrote a Firebase function to send emails when a new input is added to the collection. Added in a regex for email format and checks the db to ensure email is unique to the collection. Setup a Firestore db for future use to accept templates to autosend them to the emails in the realtime db collection. Mostly had some fun using JS for DOM manipulation.</p>

            <p class="card-text">This was a proof of concept for a community based audio recording website that was intended to be used by a library in Redruth UK. It was designed with a minimal use case. Users audio recordings are stored in AWS S3 buckets and data in Mongodb. Western Washington University has taken it on as an ongoing project to expand its use case and explore its potential. If you save a recording it requires the Webmaster to approve it before it becomes available to the public.</p>

            <p class="card-text">My first webpage. I used a Summer my first year in school to learn a bit of HTML and CSS and this was what I came up with. It was a fun start I learned it was easy to build a web page, but difficult to make it usefull, well with just those tools, what a difference JS makes. Wanting to be able to work anywhere I go, it was a proof of concept that I could do this while travelling at 70mph, no worries, my wife was driving.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Next I learned about responsive design and wanted to explore it. Expanding on what I had learned, I used more styling to explore what i could make. While no master of design, I was quickly learning the technical aptitude to make things appear on the screen just how I wanted them. I could do so much better today, but it still sparks the creative side of my geekiness. Inspired by a local business that had to shut it's doors.</p>

It's unfortunate we had so little time to develop a plan and use the software development life cycle. Short turn arounds often drove us to begin to develop before a plan was fully explored wich required scope creep to as the app design evolved during development.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Final group project for UW certification, our concept was to create a video conference site that had multiple rooms similar to different classrooms or offices that users could move in and out of. My focus was on the server side particularly getting the video streaming API to work, the database for user account creation and login validation. I love the concept and will continue to work on it, watch out zoom.</p>

I made the 256 char random unique key stored in a cookie to identify return users, made API requests getting data based on device location. Used derived location data to create directed ads, and graphs for census data demonstrating how users could be profiled. Contributed to styling by creating automation with javascript.</p>
